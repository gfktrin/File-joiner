# File-joiner
Allows to join files and switch between one or another.
## Usage
First you need to join two files, note that exe files don't work with image files, but can be joined with mp3 files and you can't join more than 2 files.

After that you will have a new file generated in the program's folder called "newfile" with the same extension of the first file joined. Now you can open the program and select that file an put the second file's extension and see the magic.

You can change between the two extensions anytime you want.
